tubulinBindInteractionType: "implicit" # The type of tubulin binding interaction to use. Options are 'explicit' and 'implicit'.
defaultTubulinUnbindingRate: 1000.0           # The default unbinding rate for tubulin.
proteinEnhancedTubulinUnbindingRate: 0  # The unbinding rate for tubulin when a protein is present at the end of the microtubule.
proteinEnhancementCutoffDistance: 0.0125 # The distance from the end of the microtubule at which a protein enhances the unbinding rate of tubulin.
tubulinBindingRate: 0.0         # The rate (binds per unit time) at which tubulin binds to the end of a microtubule.
tubulinLength: 0.2             # The length of a tubulin. We set it to be the same as the rod diameter, but it can be whatever you want.
tubulinLoadBalanceFrequency: 50 # The frequency (in number of timesteps between load balance calls) at which the
